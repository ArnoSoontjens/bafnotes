# Bafnotes

A notes app written in Flutter, that should support text and audio notes and run on Android and iOS.

My motivation to write this app is twofold:
1. The primary reason is improving my coding skills in Flutter. I will (try to) make informed choices about things like which database to use, statemanagement approach and much more. For that purpose, I will regularly update the sections in this README with all new information I come across or learn, with the intent to turn this document into a tutorial / blogpost series kind of thing. 
2. I use a notes app daily, but am not really satisfied with the features most of them offer or the way they look / feel. I didn't really research this much though, as I made the decision to build an app myself fairly quickly.

The final goal is to create a notes app that is quick and easy to use with a cool design, to be released as a free app to the Google Play Store. 

## Features
* Add, save, review, edit, delete notes (TODO)
* Add multiple different things to notes, that correspond to a different layout for the shown note in the UI (TODO):

  * Lists (todo, shopping, books, songs, ...)

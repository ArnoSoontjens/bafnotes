# Bafnotes

A notes app written in Flutter, that should support text and audio notes and run on Android and iOS.

My motivation to write this app is twofold:
1. The primary reason is improving my coding skills in Flutter. I will (try) to make informed choices about things like which database to use, statemanagement approach and much more. For that purpose, I will regularly update the sections in this README with all new information a come across or learn, with the intent to turn it into a tutorial / blogpost series kind of thing (not sure about that yet). 
2. I use a notes app daily, but am not really satisfied with the features most of them offer or the way they look / feel. I didn't really research this much though, as I made the decission to build an app myself fairly quickly.

The final goals is to create notes app that is quick and easy to use with a cool design, to be released as a free app to the Google Play Store.
